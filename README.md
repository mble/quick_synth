QuickSynth
==========

Elixir-based synthesizer. To use, evalute:

`QuickSynth.Sound.play("C")`

If you want to build compositions, you can do that like so:

`QuickSynth.Composition.play(100, "CEGCEEABCGE")`

To run the keyboard UI, evaluate:

`QuickSynth.UI.start`

Then click in the window and play with the bottom two rows of the keyboard.

### TODO

* Guitars are cool, but better to replace with sine or saw waves.
* Resurrect acid house
